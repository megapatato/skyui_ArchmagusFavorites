### Resolutions & Screen Size

The following aspect ratios are offered in the mod's FOMOD installer:

|ratio      |example        |name / usage   |
|-|-|-|
|32:9       |3840 x 1080    |Super-wide     |
|21:9       |2560 x 1080    |Ultra-wide     |
|16:9       |1920 x 1080    |FullHD, 4K     |
|16:10      |1728 x 1080    |WXGA et al     |
|3:2        |1620 x 1080    |Microsoft's Surface line|
|4:3        |1440 x 1080    |Like PAL & NTSC|

The assets are vectorized, so only the width/height proportion is relevant. As Flash files, they will expand to fit the screen.


### Languages

Translation files are included for the 9 languages Skyrim ships in: English, Spanish, French, Italian, Czech, German, Japanese, Polish, and Russian.

The empty plugin file, `.ESP`, only serves to signal to the Skyrim Script Extender that the translation files need loading. It is light-flagged.
